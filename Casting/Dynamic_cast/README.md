# Pros:
- Safeâ€”performs runtime type checking ensuring the object is actually of the target type.
- Helps prevent undefined behavior from invalid downcasts.

# Cons:
- Runtime overhead due to type checking.
- Only applicable to polymorphic classes (those that contain virtual functions).

# Real-World Analogy:
Imagine a security checkpoint that verifies the identity of a person before granting access to a restricted area. Only if the credentials match (the object truly belongs to the derived class) can access be given. This process is safe but takes extra time.
