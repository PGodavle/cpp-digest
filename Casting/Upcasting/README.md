# Upcasting (Derived → Base)

# What It Is: 
Upcasting is converting a pointer or reference of a derived (child) class to a pointer or reference of its base (parent) class.

# How It Works: 
This conversion is implicit and safe because every derived object inherently contains the base part.

# Real-World Analogy:
Every employee in the "Software Development" department is inherently an employee of the company. When you refer to someone as an "employee" (base class), you can still be dealing with a software developer (derived class). This conversion (SoftwareDeveloper → Employee) is natural and implicit.
