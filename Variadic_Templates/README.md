# Variadic Templates in C++
## What Are Variadic Templates?
Variadic templates, introduced in C++11, allow functions and classes to accept a variable number of arguments. This is useful when designing generic functions or data structures that can handle multiple types and sizes of input.
## How Variadic Templates Work
A variadic template uses parameter packs, which are expanded at compile time. The syntax involves an ellipsis (...) to indicate a pack of parameters.
## Recursive Expansion of Variadic Templates
Before C++17, variadic templates were expanded recursively.
## When to Use Variadic Templates
Variadic templates are useful when:
- Creating flexible functions (e.g., logging, printing, formatting).Check -> Logging_Function.cpp
- Building generic data structures (e.g., std::tuple). -> Custom_Tuple_Class.cpp
- Implementing type-safe operations (e.g., forwarding arguments). -> Function_Wrapper.cpp
- Reducing code duplication (e.g., multiple overloads).-> Restricting_Function_to_Only_Accept_Integers.cpp
## Real-World Analogy
Think of variadic templates like a Swiss Army knife:
- You have multiple tools (functions or classes).
- You only use the tools you need at a given time.
- The knife adapts to different situations.
Similarly, variadic templates allow functions to adapt dynamically to different numbers and types of arguments.
## Pros and Cons of Variadic Templates
✅ Pros
- Flexible and reusable (handles multiple arguments).
- Reduces code duplication (avoids multiple overloads).
- Compile-time efficiency (expands at compile time).
- Supports perfect forwarding (preserves argument types).
  
❌ Cons
- Complex debugging (error messages can be hard to interpret).
- Increased compilation time (especially with deep recursion).
- Harder to read (complicated syntax for newcomers).
- Limited runtime flexibility (expansion happens at compile time)

## Advanced Use: Perfect Forwarding
Variadic templates work well with perfect forwarding to preserve argument types.
